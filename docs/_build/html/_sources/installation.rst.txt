Installation
============

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

Create conda environment   
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To create a `conda <https://www.anaconda.com/>`_ environment with all the necessary dependencies we provide an 
:download:`environment.yml <https://github.com/schwille-paint/picasso_addon/blob/master/environment.yml>`.
 
To create the environment please open a terminal (Anaconda Prompt on Windows) and type 

.. code-block:: console
    
    (base) conda env create -f=environment.yml
    
This will create a conda environment ``picasso_addon``. To activate the environment type

.. code-block:: console

    (base) activate picasso_addon
    
The picasso_addon package requires the `picasso`_ package. Clone the repository, switch to the downloaded folder and type

.. code-block:: console

    (picasso_addon) python setup.py install
    
This will install the `picasso`_ python package into the `picasso_addon` environment. 

As a last step we will install the `picasso_addon`_ package into the ``picasso_addon`` environment. As before, we clone the repository, switch to the downloaded folder and type

.. code-block:: console

    (picasso_addon) python setup.py install

Done!  


If you don't want to install the picasso_addon package into your environment but you want to be able to import it in any IPython (Spyder, Jupyter) session do the following:
    1. Navigate to ~/.ipython/profile_default
    2. Create a folder called startup if itâ€™s not already there
    3. Add a new Python file called ``start.py`` or modify it and add 
    
    .. code-block:: python

        import sys
        sys.path.append('C:/yourpath/picasso_addon')
